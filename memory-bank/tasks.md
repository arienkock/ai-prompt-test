This is a TODO list  tasks for this project:

  - [ ] Signing in with the - wrong email & passwords redirects you back to the login page. This is bad UX.
  - [ ] Playwright happy-path e2e test.
  - [ ] Use cases should indicate whether they are public or private (requiring authentication) and this should determine whether the authentication middleware is added or not.
  - [ ] Split the Dto.ts file. Each DTO should be in its own file.
